## [Unreleased] - Phase 3: Testing and Tool System Fixes

### Added
- **Developer Documentation**
  - Comprehensive "How to Create a Plugin" guide with examples and best practices
  - Detailed "How to Create a Tool" guide with multiple example implementations
  - Step-by-step tutorials for both plugin and tool development
  - Testing guidelines and debugging tips

- **Chat System Integration**
  - Standardized chat events (`CHAT_MESSAGE_SENT`, `CHAT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED`) added to `core.events`.
  - `ChatInputPanel` now publishes chat events on the global `EVENT_BUS`.
  - `ChatWidget` subscribes to chat events and updates the UI appropriately.

### Fixed
- **Tool System Import Issues**
  - Fixed relative import issues in creative_tool.py, delay_tool.py, playful_tool.py, proactive_tool.py
  - Completely rewrote plugin_tool.py to work with new PluginSystem API
  - Moved legacy tools with missing dependencies to tools/legacy/ directory
  - Resolved all tool loading failures - now 5/5 tools load successfully

### Improved
- **System Reliability**
  - Tool system now fully operational with 100% success rate for available tools
  - All core systems (application, plugin_system, tool_manager, event_bus, config) validated
  - Integration tests confirm system stability

### In Progress
- **Test Coverage Improvement**: Creating comprehensive tests for core modules
- **Documentation Completion**: Working on architecture overview and EventBus documentation

### Current System Status (2025-07-01)
- **Core Systems**: ✅ All 5 core systems operational
- **Plugin System**: ✅ 3/3 demo plugins working (git_integration, system_monitor, spotify_control)
- **Tool System**: ✅ 5/5 tools loaded successfully (creative, delay, playful, plugin, proactive)
- **Event System**: ✅ EventBus communication validated
- **Configuration**: ✅ Config system working correctly
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ Needs improvement (target 75% minimum)
- **Integration Tests**: ✅ Core system integration validated

### Issues Resolved
- ✅ Fixed legacy tool import failures (relative imports, missing modules) by refactoring and moving to legacy/
- ✅ Tool System now operational with 5/5 tools loading successfully
- ✅ Plugin system fully operational with 3 demo plugins

### Issues to Resolve
- Test coverage requiring extensive expansion toward 75% target
- Missing UI panel for log viewing
- Documentation guides for developers (how-to create plugins/tools)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-01 - Phase 2: Deep Integration Completed

- **UI Integration Updates**
  - Updated `PluginManagerUI` to work with new `PluginSystem` API
  - Modernized `ToolManagerUI` with comprehensive management features
  - Real-time status updates through event system integration
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### Changed
- **Plugin System Architecture**
  - Replaced legacy plugin manager with new `PluginSystem` class
  - Changed plugin discovery to use class introspection instead of naming conventions
  - Updated plugin metadata to support rich data types (`Dict[str, Any]`)
  - Enhanced plugin initialization to support both sync and async operations

- **Application Lifecycle**
  - Modified `AtlasApplication` to include all core systems in constructor
  - Added headless operation mode with `start()` method
  - Improved system initialization order and dependency management

- **Event System Integration**
  - All core components now communicate through `EventBus`
  - Plugin and tool state changes generate events automatically
  - UI components automatically react to backend state changes

### Fixed

- **Event System**: Message passing between components works correctly
- **Error Handling**: Self-healing mechanisms function as designed

## 📊 Current System Status

### Core Systems: 5/5 ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **Config**: Environment-based configuration loading
- **Event Bus**: Message-driven communication
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic plugin management  
- **Tool Manager**: Tool discovery and execution
- **Self Healing**: Error recovery and system resilience

### Plugins: 3/12 ✅ LOADED (25% success rate)
**✅ Working Plugins:**
- `git_integration` - Full Git operations
- `system_monitor` - System resource monitoring  
- `spotify_control` - macOS media control

**⚠️ Plugins with Issues:**
- 9 legacy plugins need refactoring to match new plugin architecture

### Tools: In Development
- Tool discovery system implemented
- Many tools have import dependency issues that need resolution
- Base architecture is solid for expansion

## 🏗️ Architecture Achievements

### Event-Driven Design
```
EventBus ← AtlasApplication → PluginSystem
    ↑            ↓              ↓
ToolManager ← SelfHealing → ModuleRegistry
```

### Plugin Architecture
```
PluginBase (Abstract)
    ↓
GitIntegrationPlugin
SpotifyControlPlugin  
SystemMonitorPlugin
```

### Configuration Hierarchy
```
Environment Variables → Config → Application Settings
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 3)

### Immediate Priorities:
